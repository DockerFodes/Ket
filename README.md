# ‚≠ê Ket ‚≠ê
‚ú® Ket is an excellent bot for Discord made in TypeScript using Eris ‚ú®

There's not much to see here, but if you want to run Ket on your machine you'll need:
- NodeJS (Recommended version: 14.18.1 or higher, Download: https://nodejs.org/pt-br/)
- PostgreSQL (Recommended version: 14 or higher, Download: https://www.postgresql.org/download/)
- GIT CLI (Download: https://git-scm.com/downloads)

# How to install ü§î
- Download the above files or clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/KetDiscordBot/Ket
```
- Install the necessary dependencies to run the project:
```bash
cd Ket
npm install

- You may need to install 2 packages separately:

npm install -g typescript pm2
```
- Rename the ".env.example" file to ".env"
- Complete the information of ".env" and "settings.json" (src/json/settings.json)

I hope you like the project :)
